Let $K$ be a complex endowed with two filtrations, $W$ and $F$, with the filtration $F$ biregular.
Let $r_0\geqslant0$ be an integer, and suppose that, for $0\leqslant r<r_0$, the differentials of the graded complex $E_r(K,W)$ are strictly compatible with the filtration $F$.
Then, for $r\leqslant r_0+1$, $F_d=F_r=F_{d^*}$ on $E_r^{pq}$.

We will prove the theorem by induction on $r_0$.
For $r_0=0$, the hypothesis is empty, and we apply \ref{hodge-theory-ii-lemma-1.3.10} and (iii) of \ref{hodge-theory-ii-proposition-1.3.13}.
For $r_0\geqslant1$, by the inductive hypothesis, we have $F_d=F_r=F_{d^*}$ on $E_r^{pq}$ for $r\leqslant r_0$.

By \ref{hodge-theory-ii-lemma-1.3.15}, the morphism $u\colon E_0(\Dec(K))\to E_1(K)$ is a filtered quasi-isomorphism.
It thus induces a filtered isomorphism from $\HH^\bullet(\Dec(K))$ to $\HH^\bullet(E_1(K))$:
##{
  u\colon (E_1(\Dec(K)),F_r)
  \simto (E_2(K),F_r).
}
Step-by-step, we thus deduce that the canonical isomorphism from $E_s(\Dec(K))$ to $E_{s+1}$ (for $s\geqslant1$) is a filtered isomorphism for the recurrent filtration.

On $E_1(\Dec(K))$, $F_r=F_d$ (\ref{hodge-theory-ii-lemma-1.3.10}), and we already know (\ref{hodge-theory-ii-1.3.14}) that $u'$ is a filtered isomorphism
##{
  u'\colon (E_1(\Dec(K)),F_d)
  \simto (E_2(K),F_d).
}

On $E_2(K)$, we thus have $F_d=F_r$.
This, combined with the dual result, proves the theorem for $r_0=1$.

Suppose that $r_0\geqslant2$.
Then the arrows $d_1$ of $E_1(K)$ are strictly compatible with the filtrations, and thus so too are the arrows $d_0$ of $E_0(\Dec(K))$ (indeed, $u$ induces an isomorphism of spectral sequences, and we apply the criterion from \ref{hodge-theory-ii-proposition-1.3.2}).

For $0<s<r_0-1$, the isomorphism $(E_s(\Dec(K)),F_r)\cong(E_{s+1}(K),F_r)$ shows that the $d_s$ are strictly compatible with the recurrent filtrations.

By the induction hypothesis, we thus have $F_d=F_r$ on $E_s(\Dec(K))$ for $s\leqslant s_0$.
The isomorphism $(E_s(\Dec(K)),F_d)\cong(E_{s+1}(K),F_d)$ (\ref{hodge-theory-ii-proposition-1.3.13}) then shows that $F_d=F_r$ on $E_r(K)$ for $r\leqslant r_0+1$.
This, combined with the dual result, proves the theorem.

Under the general hypotheses of \ref{hodge-theory-ii-theorem-1.3.16}, suppose that, for all $r$, the differentials $d_r$ are strictly compatible with the recurrent filtrations on the $E_r$.
Then, on $E_\infty$, the filtrations $F_d$, $F_r$, and $F_{d^*}$ agree, and coincide with the filtration induced by the filtration $F$ of $\HH^\bullet(K)$.

This follows immediately from \ref{hodge-theory-ii-theorem-1.3.16} and (iv) of \ref{hodge-theory-ii-proposition-1.3.13}.
