Let $K$ be a differential complex of objects of $\mathscr{A}$, endowed with two filtrations $F$ and $W$.
Let $E_r^{pq}$ be the spectral sequence defined by $W$.
The filtration $F$ induces on $E_r^{pq}$ various filtrations, which we will compare.

Definitions \ref{hodge-theory-ii-1.3.8} and \ref{hodge-theory-ii-1.3.9} still make sense for $r=\infty$.
If the filtration on $K$ is biregular, then the direct filtrations on $E_\infty^{pq}$ coincide with those on $E_r^{pq}=E_\infty^{pq}$ for large enough $r$, and we define the recurrent filtration on $E_\infty^{pq}$ as agreeing with that on $E_r^{pq}$ for large enough $r$.

The filtrations $F$ and $W$ each induce a filtration on $H^\bullet(K)$, and $E_\infty^{\bullet\bullet}=\Gr_W^\bullet(\HH^\bullet(K))$.
The filtration $F$ on $\HH^\bullet(K)$ then induces on $E_\infty^{pq}$ a new filtration.

i. For the first direct filtration, the morphisms $d_r$ are compatible with the filtrations.
  If $E_{r+1}^{pq}$ is considered as a quotient of a sub-object of $E_r^{pq}$, then the first direct filtration on $E_{r+1}^{pq}$ is finer than the filtration $F'$ induced by the first direct filtration on $E_r^{pq}$Y we have $F_d(E_{r+1}^{pq})\subset F'(E_{r+1}^{pq})$.
ii. Dually, the morphisms $d_r$ are compatible with the second direct filtration, and the second direct filtration on $E_{r+1}^{pq}$ is less fine than the filtration induced by that of $E_r^{pq}$.
iii. $F_d(E_r^{pq})\subset F_r(E_r^{pq})\subset F_{d^*}(E_r^{pq})$.

We denote by $\Dec(K)$ (resp. $\Dec^\bullet(K)$) the complex $K$ endowed with the filtrations $\Dec(W)$ and $F$ (resp. $\Dec^\bullet(W)$ and $F$).

It is clear by \ref{hodge-theory-ii-equation-1.3.4.1} that the isomorphism in \ref{hodge-theory-ii-proposition-1.3.4} sends the first direct filtration on $E_r(\Dec(K))$ to the second direct filtration on $E_{r+1}(K)$ (for $r\geqslant1$).

\oldpage{18}
By \ref{hodge-theory-ii-1.3.3} and \ref{hodge-theory-ii-proposition-1.3.4}, the complex $E_1(K,W)$ filtered by $F$ is a quotient of the filtered complex $\Gr_{\Dec(W)}(K)$.
Let $U$ be the filtered complex given by the kernel, which is acyclic by (ii) of \ref{hodge-theory-ii-proposition-1.3.4}.
The long exact sequence in cohomology associated to the exact sequence of complexes
##{
  0
  \to \Gr_F(U)
  \to \Gr_F(\Gr_{\Dec(W)}(K))
  \to \Gr_F(E_1(K,W))
  \to 0
}
shows that $u$ is a filtered quasi-isomorphism if and only if $\Gr_F(U)$ is an acyclic complex.
By \ref{hodge-theory-ii-proposition-1.3.2}, and since $U$ is acyclic, this reduces to asking that the differentials of $U$ be strictly compatible with the filtration $F$.
From \ref{hodge-theory-ii-equation-1.3.3.1} we obtain that $U$ is the sum over $p$ of the complexes
##{
  (U^p)^n
  = B_1^{p+n,-p}/Z_1^{p+1+n,-p-1}

endowed with the filtration induced by $F$.

Each differential $d$ of each of the complexes $U^p$ fits into a commutative diagram of filtered objects of the following type, where, for simplicity, we have omitted the total or complementary degree:

\todo{**!!TO-DO: diagram!!**}

By hypothesis, the morphism $(1)$ is strict.
Since the square $(2)$ is exactly the canonical decomposition of $(1)$, the arrow $(3)$ is a filtered isomorphism.
The arrows of the trapezium $(4)$ are isomorphisms;
they are thus filtered isomorphisms, since $(3)$ is a filtered isomorphism.
The fact that $(5)$ is a filtered isomorphism implies that $d$ is strict.
This proves the lemma.

\subtree[theorem-1.3.16 title="Theorem 1.3.16" latex="{Theorem 1.3.16}"}
Let $K$ be a complex endowed with two filtrations, $W$ and $F$, with the filtration $F$ biregular.
Let $r_0\geqslant0$ be an integer, and suppose that, for $0\leqslant r<r_0$, the differentials of the graded complex $E_r(K,W)$ are strictly compatible with the filtration $F$.
Then, for $r\leqslant r_0+1$, $F_d=F_r=F_{d^*}$ on $E_r^{pq}$.
:::

::: {.proof}
We will prove the theorem by induction on $r_0$.
For $r_0=0$, the hypothesis is empty, and we apply \ref{hodge-theory-ii-lemma-1.3.10} and (iii) of \ref{hodge-theory-ii-proposition-1.3.13}.
For $r_0\geqslant1$, by the inductive hypothesis, we have $F_d=F_r=F_{d^*}$ on $E_r^{pq}$ for $r\leqslant r_0$.

\oldpage{19}
By \ref{hodge-theory-ii-lemma-1.3.15}, the morphism $u\colon E_0(\Dec(K))\to E_1(K)$ is a filtered quasi-isomorphism.
It thus induces a filtered isomorphism from $\HH^\bullet(\Dec(K))$ to $\HH^\bullet(E_1(K))$:
##{
  u\colon (E_1(\Dec(K)),F_r)
  \simto (E_2(K),F_r).
}
Step-by-step, we thus deduce that the canonical isomorphism from $E_s(\Dec(K))$ to $E_{s+1}$ (for $s\geqslant1$) is a filtered isomorphism for the recurrent filtration.

On $E_1(\Dec(K))$, $F_r=F_d$ (\ref{hodge-theory-ii-lemma-1.3.10}), and we already know (\ref{hodge-theory-ii-1.3.14}) that $u'$ is a filtered isomorphism
##{
  u'\colon (E_1(\Dec(K)),F_d)
  \simto (E_2(K),F_d).
}

On $E_2(K)$, we thus have $F_d=F_r$.
This, combined with the dual result, proves the theorem for $r_0=1$.

Suppose that $r_0\geqslant2$.
Then the arrows $d_1$ of $E_1(K)$ are strictly compatible with the filtrations, and thus so too are the arrows $d_0$ of $E_0(\Dec(K))$ (indeed, $u$ induces an isomorphism of spectral sequences, and we apply the criterion from \ref{hodge-theory-ii-proposition-1.3.2}).

For $0<s<r_0-1$, the isomorphism $(E_s(\Dec(K)),F_r)\cong(E_{s+1}(K),F_r)$ shows that the $d_s$ are strictly compatible with the recurrent filtrations.

By the induction hypothesis, we thus have $F_d=F_r$ on $E_s(\Dec(K))$ for $s\leqslant s_0$.
The isomorphism $(E_s(\Dec(K)),F_d)\cong(E_{s+1}(K),F_d)$ (\ref{hodge-theory-ii-proposition-1.3.13}) then shows that $F_d=F_r$ on $E_r(K)$ for $r\leqslant r_0+1$.
This, combined with the dual result, proves the theorem.

Under the general hypotheses of \ref{hodge-theory-ii-theorem-1.3.16}, suppose that, for all $r$, the differentials $d_r$ are strictly compatible with the recurrent filtrations on the $E_r$.
Then, on $E_\infty$, the filtrations $F_d$, $F_r$, and $F_{d^*}$ agree, and coincide with the filtration induced by the filtration $F$ of $\HH^\bullet(K)$.
