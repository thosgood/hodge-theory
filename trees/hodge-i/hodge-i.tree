  We intend to give a heuristic dictionary between statements in #{l}-adic cohomology and statements in Hodge theory.
  This dictionary has as its most notable sources [[S1960]](S1960) and the conjectural theory of Grothendieck motives [[D1969]](D1969).
  Up until now, it has mainly served to formulate conjectures in Hodge theory, and it has sometimes even suggested a proof.
